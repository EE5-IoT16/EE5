# Getting Started

Clone the repository to desired location.
```git
git clone https://github.com/SamuelTocci/EE5.git
```
Then cd into the project.

NVM: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
We are using 16.14.0 version
to use it:
```powershell
nvm install 16
nvm use 16.14.0
```
(keep in mind to use command you need to run it with administrator rights.)

To run the software change directory to packages/api directory and run node server.js command.

```powershell
cd packages/api
node server.js
```

Before starting to develop a certain part of the project create a branch and work on it. After you finish create a merge request.
